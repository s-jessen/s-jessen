## Hi there, I'm Søren👋

I'm a bioinformatician/physiologist with 10+ years in clinical research primarily relating to β₂-adrenergic stimulation in skeletal muscle. I specialize in data science and analysis of large complex data sets.

- 🎓 PhD in Human Physiology — focused on muscle biology & β₂-adrenergic stimulation
- 🎓 MSc Human Physiology
- 🎓 MSc Computational Biomedicine

### On my GitHub, you’ll find completed and ongoing projects
- 🧬 Proteomics pipeline — data wrangling & analysis for complex omics datasets
- 🐳 Proteomics + Snakemake + Docker — fully reproducible, containerized workflow magic
- 🧠 Machine learning approaches (Neural Network and Random Forest) to classify clinical samples
- 🐍 Python simulation — a fun and interactive simulation relating to the spread of fire in a virtual forest
- 🧬 RNA-seq pipeline — reproducible differential expression analysis with Snakemake + Docker

### My skills and interests
- 💻 Python, R, Snakemake, Docker, Git, Linux (Arch, btw)
- 📈 Machine learning, statistical modeling, pharmacokinetics, proteomics
- 🧹 Always aiming for clean, sharable, reproducible code
