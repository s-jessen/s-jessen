## Hi there, I'm Søren👋

I'm a bioinformatician/physiologist with 10+ years in clinical research primarily relating to β₂-adrenergic stimulation in skeletal muscle. I specialize in data science and analysis of large complex data sets.

- 🎓 PhD in Human Physiology — focused on muscle biology & β₂-adrenergic stimulation
- 🎓 MSc Human Physiology
- 🎓 MSc Computational Biomedicine

### On my GitHub, you’ll find completed and ongoing projects
- 🐳 [Proteomics + Snakemake + Docker — fully reproducible, containerized workflow](https://github.com/s-jessen/b2a_res_single_fiber)
- 🐳 [Phosphoproteomics pipeline to dissect insulin and exercise induced phosphorylation events in skeletal muscle](https://github.com/s-jessen/phosphoproteomics_insulin_exercise)
- 🧬 [RNA-seq pipeline — reproducible differential expression analysis with Snakemake + Docker](https://github.com/s-jessen/rna_seq)
- 🧠 [Machine learning approaches (Neural Network and Random Forest) to classify clinical samples](https://github.com/s-jessen/machine_learning_classification_heart_disease)
- 🐍 [Python simulation — a fun and interactive simulation relating to the spread of fire in a virtual forest](https://github.com/s-jessen/simulation_python_firefighters)
- 🔎 [Clustering lab — hands-on exploration of K-means, EM, and DBSCAN for identification of crescent vs. spherical clusters](https://github.com/s-jessen/clustering_algorithms)

### My skills and interests
- 💻 Python, R, Snakemake, Docker, Git, Linux (Arch, btw)
- 📈 Machine learning, statistical modeling, pharmacokinetics, proteomics
- 🧹 Always aiming for clean, sharable, reproducible code
